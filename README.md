## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that as a dev we need to practice from time to time to go back to basics to make sure we still grasps the basic concepts and not rely on frameworks at all.


### Continued development

I'd like to make more generic styles and implement CSS Grid in the future and maybe work on a tablet version of it.
